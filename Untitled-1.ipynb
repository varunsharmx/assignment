    "\n",
    "    Mutable Objects-     \n",

    "5. Explain the concept of type casting in python with examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Type casting in Python is the process of converting one data type into another. This is useful when you need to perform operations that require a specific type or when you want to ensure that values are treated consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Types of Type Casting  \n",
    "    1. Implicit Type Casting (Coercion):  \n",
    "    - This occurs automatically when Python converts one data type to another without explicit instruction. It typically happens when a smaller data type is used in an operation with a larger data type.  \n",
    "    - Example:  \n",
    "        a = 5         # Integer  \n",
    "        b = 2.0       # Float  \n",
    "        result = a + b  # Implicitly converts 'a' to float  \n",
    "        print(result)  # Output: 7.0 (float)  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Explicit Type Casting:  \n",
    "    - This requires using built-in functions to convert data types. It is done manually and provides more control over the conversion process.  \n",
    "    - Common functions used for explicit type casting include:\n",
    "        * int(): Converts a value to an integer.  \n",
    "        * float(): Converts a value to a float.  \n",
    "        * str(): Converts a value to a string.  \n",
    "        * list(): Converts a value to a list.  \n",
    "        * tuple(): Converts a value to a tuple.  \n",

    "    Examples of Explicit Type Casting  \n",

    "        num_str = \"10\"  \n",
    "        num_int = int(num_str)  # Converts string to integer  \n",
    "        print(num_int)           # Output: 10  \n",

    "6. How to conditional statements work in python? illustrate with examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Conditional statements in Python allow you to execute certain blocks of code based on specific conditions. The most common conditional statements are if, elif, and else. These statements help control the flow of a program based on whether a condition is true or false.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    Basic Structure  \n",
    "    The basic syntax for conditional statements is:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    if condition:  \n",
    "        # Code to execute if condition is true  \n",
    "    elif another_condition:  \n",
    "        # Code to execute if the first condition is false and this condition is true  \n",
    "    else:  \n",
    "        # Code to execute if all previous conditions are false  \n",
    "\n",
    "    Examples  \n",
    "    1. Simple If Statement:  \n",
    "    age = 18  \n",
    "    if age >= 18:  \n",
    "        print(\"You are an adult.\")  # This will be printed  \n",

    "    else:  \n",
    "        print(\"It's a cool day.\")  \n",

    "    3. If-Elif-Else Statement:  \n",
    "    score = 85  \n",

    "    else:  \n",
    "        print(\"Negative number or zero\")  \n",
    "\n",
    "    5. Using Logical Operators: Conditional statements can also use logical operators (and, or, not) to combine multiple conditions.  \n",
    "    age = 20  \n",
    "    has_permission = True  \n",
    "    if age >= 18 and has_permission:  \n",

    "    In Python, loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition. The two primary types of loops are for loops and while loops. Each has its specific use cases and syntax.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    1. For Loop  \n",
    "    The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range). It is commonly used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.  \n",

    "         #Code to execute  \n",
    "        \n",
    "    Example:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    Iterating over a list:  \n",
    "        fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]  \n",
    "        for fruit in fruits:  \n",

    "        apple  \n",

    "\n",
    "    2. While Loop  \n",
    "    The while loop continues to execute as long as a specified condition is true. It is useful when the number of iterations is not known in advance and depends on a dynamic condition.  \n",
    "    Syntax:  \n",
    "    while condition:  \n",
    "        #Code to execute  \n",

    "    - Implementing countdowns or other iterative processes that depend on changing values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Nested Loops  \n",
    "    You can nest loops, meaning you can place one loop inside another. This is often used in more complex scenarios.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    Example: \n",
    "\n",

    "        i: 2, j: 0  \n",
    "        i: 2, j: 1  \n",
    "\n",
    "    Use Cases:  \n",
    "    - Iterating over a matrix or a list of lists.  \n",
    "    - Performing operations that require multiple levels of iteration.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Loop Control Statements  \n",
    "    Additionally, there are control statements that can alter the flow of loops:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - break: Exits the loop prematurely. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Example:  \n",
    "    for num in range(10):  \n",
    "        if num == 5:  \n",
    "            break  \n",
    "        print(num)  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - continue: Skips the current iteration and continues with the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example:  \n",
    "    for num in range(5):  \n",
    "        if num == 2:  \n",
    "            continue  \n",
    "        print(num)   \n",
    "\n",
    "    - else: Can be used with loops to execute a block of code when the loop completes normally (i.e., not exited with break).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example:  \n",
    "    for num in range(3):  \n",
    "        print(num)  \n",
    "    else:  \n",
    "        print(\"Loop completed without break.\")  \n",
    "\n",
    "    Summary \n",
    "\n",
    "    - for Loop: Best for iterating over a sequence or a known range.  \n",
    "    - while Loop: Best for situations where the number of iterations is not known in advance.  \n",
